SmartBear Collaborator JIRA Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin is designed to work with JIRA 5.x.x and supports creating (or adding to) reviews from git and svn commits.
This plugin works in conjunction with pre-installed Fisheye plugin and uses commits attached to JIRA issue through Fisheye plugin.

This plugin is based mostly on the json api provided by Collaborator and rest api provided by Fisheye server, with third party
libraries to create/send/receive http requests and responses.
To interact with the Collaborator server and Fisheye server the plugin uses Jersey 1.02 and Jackson 1.9.13

In the plugin module there are 2 features:
Plugin configuration: configuration connection of each JIRA Project with Collaborator server and Fisheye server
Create/Update Review: this is an JIRA issue action to create new review or update existing review with new scm commits.

Setup instructions:
The Universal Plugin Manager (UPM) makes it easy to install add-ons. With just a few clicks, you can browse the Atlassian Marketplace 
and install add-ons in your application, all without leaving the administration interface of your Atlassian product.
Alternatively, you can install add-ons by file upload. The file upload procedure installs an add-on as a JAR or an OBR (OSGi Bundle Repository) file. 
The archive file should contain the plugin code and resource files. File upload enables you to install custom add-ons or any add-on not available on Atlassian Marketplace. 
You can also use it to install add-ons for applications operating behind a firewall and disconnected from the Internet.

Build instructions:
1. Install the Atlassian SDK
2. Go to JIRA project root folder and run command "atlas-package"
https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/getting-started/set-up-the-atlassian-plugin-sdk-and-build-a-project

If you need compiled Collaborator JIRA plugin, you can find it in target folder.
